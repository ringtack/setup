My setup!

Currently, I use Kitty as my terminal emulator, with [Fira Code Nerd
Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode/)
for ligatures, Powerline glyphs, and filetype icons. I recently migrated
from Vim to Neovim; legacy vim configurations can be found in `vim/`.
For both, I use the One Dark color scheme.
